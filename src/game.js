// Unicorn Rainbow Racer — js13k 2026.
//
// The unicorn is the reference model itself: MESH_P and MESH_C are generated
// from the STL by tools/stl2mesh.mjs. This file gives it normals and, more
// interestingly, works out which vertices belong to which leg so the shader can
// run it — the model is a 3D-print solid with no rigging, so the weights have to
// be derived from where each vertex sits rather than read from the file.
//
// Everything here is plain globals, no imports: this file is concatenated with
// the runtime, the compiled shaders and the mesh, and minified as one program.

/**
 * Which leg a vertex belongs to, and how far down it.
 *
 * A print model has no bones, so this is inferred: anything below the belly and
 * within reach of a hip is that leg's, and how far below decides how much it
 * moves. Ambiguity only arises between the two legs on the same side, and they
 * are far enough apart in x that nearest-hip wins cleanly.
 *
 * This takes a *vertex*, never a triangle, and that is the whole point. Deciding
 * per triangle — from its centre, say — lets one physical corner come out
 * weighted 0.44 in one face and 0 in the face next to it, because the two
 * triangles classified differently. The corner then swings in one and stays put
 * in the other, and the surface splits along that edge. Those are the triangles
 * that looked static: they were not failing to move, they were being held still
 * by a neighbour that disagreed about them.
 *
 * Keyed on position, a shared corner gets one answer no matter how many faces
 * meet there, so there is nothing to disagree about.
